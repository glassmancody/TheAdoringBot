        "eh I would say it's pretty factual you become stronger. Your weapon does more damage, you unlock abilities you can't access at all from the start, and the passives from the shells do add up to give you direct strength",
        "best souls like not made by FromSoft I have ever played is probably Code Vein but that game will also easily scare off anyone who doesn't like the anime appearance lmao",
        "yeah the level design is not amazing but it's not nearly as bad as mortal shell either",
        "the thing I like about code vein is that it actually adds a new system to the combat of souls that actually impoves upon it significantly and not just a sidegrade",
        "the deal with code vein is that you get this blood magic type shit that can be either spells or buffs that you continuously cast on yourself and it uses a resource called ichor. To get ichor you need to land attacks with your weapon, and parries and backstabs give extra. Thus, you end up having this combat loop of chaining together your weapon attacks with either spells or buffs which is really engaging as it actively encourages you to use all the games systems together",

I'm told to go in and have a seat and my manager leaves. The boss looks at me and asks-",
